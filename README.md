Description: My project is about researching if people who use internet slang have more followers on social media than people who don't. If this is true, people who have a lot of followers spread the use of internet slang amongst others through social media and that could affect the usage of language especially amongst young people who use social media a lot.

Relevant literature: 

Research question: Do people who use internet slang have more followers on social media than people who donâ€™t use internet slang?

Significance: To see if internet slang is spread amongst many or few people, which affects language usage in the real world too.

Hypothesis: People who use internet slang have more followers than people who don't use internet slang 

Methods: Usage of Twitter corpus in correlation with Twitter follower count. Make a list of slang words to test from. Set an amount of slang usage and follower count that is the threshold for low and high amounts.
